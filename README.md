## Python support

We now provide python wrappers in a separate repository [PyLibAPR](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/PyLibAPR)

In addition to providing wrappers for most of the LibAPR functionality, the Python library contains a number of new features that simplify the generation and handling of the APR. For example:

* Interactive APR conversion
* Interactive APR z-slice viewer
* Interactive APR raycast (maximum intensity projection) viewer
* Interactive lossy compression of particle intensities


## Version 2.0 release notes

The library has changed significantly since release 1.1. __There are changes to IO and iteration that are not compatible 
with the older version__. 

* New (additional) linear access data structure, explicitly storing coordinates in the sparse dimension, 
  similar to Compressed Sparse Row.
* Block-based decomposition of the APR generation pipeline, allowing conversion of very large images.
* Expanded and improved functionality for image processing directly on the APR:
  * APR filtering (spatial convolutions).
  * [APRNumerics](./src/numerics/APRNumerics.hpp) module, including e.g. gradient computations and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.
  * CUDA GPU-accelerated convolutions and RL deconvolution (currently only supports dense 3x3x3 and 5x5x5 stencils)


## Dependencies

* HDF5 1.8.20 or higher
* OpenMP > 3.0 (optional, but recommended)
* CMake 3.6 or higher
* LibTIFF 4.0 or higher


NB: This update to 2.0 introduces changes to IO and iteration that are not compatable with old versions.

If compiling with APR_DENOISE flag the package also requires:
* Eigen3.

## Building

The repository requires submodules, and needs to be cloned recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/LibAPR.git
```

### CMake build options

Several CMake options can be given to control the build. Use the `-D` argument to set each
desired option. For example, to disable OpenMP, change the cmake calls below to
```
cmake -DAPR_USE_OPENMP=OFF ..
```

| Option | Description | Default value |
|:--|:--|:--|
| APR_BUILD_SHARED_LIB | Build shared library | OFF |
| APR_BUILD_STATIC_LIB | Build static library | ON |
| APR_BUILD_EXAMPLES | Build executable examples | OFF |
| APR_TESTS | Build unit tests | OFF |
| APR_BENCHMARK | Build executable performance benchmarks | OFF |
| APR_USE_LIBTIFF | Enable LibTIFF (Required for tests and examples) | ON |
| APR_PREFER_EXTERNAL_GTEST | Use installed gtest instead of included sources | ON |
| APR_PREFER_EXTERNAL_BLOSC | Use installed blosc instead of included sources | ON |
| APR_USE_OPENMP | Enable multithreading via OpenMP | ON |
| APR_USE_CUDA | Enable CUDA (Under development - APR conversion pipeline is currently not working with CUDA enabled) | OFF |

### Building on Linux

On Ubuntu, install the `cmake`, `build-essential`, `libhdf5-dev` and `libtiff5-dev` packages (on other distributions, refer to the documentation there, the package names will be similar). OpenMP support is provided by the GCC compiler installed as part of the `build-essential` package.

For denoising support also requires: `libeigen3-dev`

In the directory of the cloned repository, run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create the `libapr.so` library in the `build` directory.

### Building on OSX

On OSX, install the `cmake`, `hdf5` and `libtiff`  [homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages and have the [Xcode command line tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) installed.

If you want to compile with OpenMP support (Recommended), also install the `llvm` and `libomp` package via homebrew as the clang version shipped by Apple currently does not support OpenMP.

In the directory of the cloned repository, run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Building on Windows

On windows there are two working strategies we have tested. Either cheating and using WSL2 and linux above, or utilising a recent version clang-cl or clang directly as included in MSVC 2019 >16.8.6. Note for earlier versions OpenMP support did not work.

The easiest way to set up your windows environment we have found is using chocolatey + vcpkg. 

Chocolatey Install:

First install chocolatey using powershell: https://chocolatey.org/install

Open an admin powershell (for chocolatey steps)

If not installed, install git and cmake:
```
choco install -y git 
choco install -y cmake.portable
```
install the required visual studio compiler tools and clang: (Note you can also do this via downloading 2019 community and selecting the correct packages)
```
choco install visualstudio2019buildtools --params "--add Microsoft.Component.MSBuild --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.Clang --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Llvm.ClangToolset --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.NativeDesktop.Llvm.Clang --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.19041	--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.UWP.VC.BuildTools"
choco install -y llvm
```
Now install your dependencies using vcpkg, in an install directory (VCPKG_PATH) of your choice do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
./vcpkg.exe install blosc:x64-windows gtest:x64-windows tiff:x64-windows hdf5:x64-windows szip:x64-windows
```
Now navigate to your cloned LibAPR directory (git clone --recursive https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/LibAPR.git). You should have all dependencies set up to be able to build the library with clang-cl `-A x64 -T ClangCL` and to search for dependencies from vcpkg at your vcpkg install location: `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="VCPKG_PATH/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows` .

Now for example to build the tests and examples (Please note you will need to update below with your own VCPKG_PATH from the steps above.
```
mkdir build
cd build

Cmake -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="VCPKG_PATH/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -T ClangCL -DAPR_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DAPR_TESTS=ON ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The above examples is also used in CI and can be executed in the cmake-build_windows.sh

### Docker build

We provide a working Dockerfile that installs the library within the image in a separate [repository](https://github.com/MSusik/libaprdocker).

Note: not recently tested.

## Install instructions 

Please see: INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md and https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/APR_cpp_project_example for a minimal project using the APR.

## Examples and Documentation

There are 12 basic examples, that show how to generate and compute with the APR. These can be built by adding 
-DAPR_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON to the cmake command.

| Example | How to ... |
|:--|:--|
| [Example_get_apr](./examples/Example_get_apr.cpp) | create an APR from a TIFF and store as hdf5. |
| [Example_get_apr_by_block](./examples/Example_get_apr_by_block.cpp) | create an APR from a (potentially large) TIFF, by decomposing it into smaller blocks, and store as hdf5.
| [Example_apr_iterate](./examples/Example_apr_iterate.cpp) | iterate over APR particles and their spatial properties. |
| [Example_apr_tree](./examples/Example_apr_tree.cpp) | iterate over interior APR tree particles and their spatial properties. |
| [Example_neighbour_access](./examples/Example_neighbour_access.cpp) | access particle and face neighbours. |
| [Example_compress_apr](./examples/Example_compress_apr.cpp) |  additionally compress the intensities stored in an APR. |
| [Example_random_access](./examples/Example_random_access.cpp) | perform random access operations on particles. |
| [Example_ray_cast](./examples/Example_ray_cast.cpp) | perform a maximum intensity projection ray cast directly on the APR. |
| [Example_reconstruct_image](./examples/Example_reconstruct_image.cpp) | reconstruct a pixel image from an APR. |
| [Example_compute_gradient](./examples/Example_compute_gradient.cpp) | compute the gradient magnitude of an APR. |
| [Example_apr_filter](./examples/Example_apr_filter.cpp) | apply a filter (convolution) to an APR. |
| [Example_apr_deconvolution](./examples/Example_apr_deconvolution.cpp) | perform Richardson-Lucy deconvolution on an APR. |

All examples except `Example_get_apr` and `Example_get_apr_by_block` require an already produced APR, such as those created by `Example_get_apr*`.

For tutorial on how to use the examples, and explanation of data-structures see [the library guide](./docs/lib_guide.pdf).

## LibAPR Tests

The testing framework can be turned on by adding -DAPR_TESTS=ON to the cmake command. All tests can then be run by executing
```
ctest
```
on the command line in your build folder. Please let us know by creating an issue, if any of these tests are failing on your machine.

## Java wrappers

Basic Java wrappers can be found at [LibAPR-java-wrapper](https://github.com/krzysg/LibAPR-java-wrapper) Not compatable with recent releases.

## Coming soon

* Improved documentation and updated library guide.
* More examples of APR-based image processing and segmentation.
* CUDA GPU-accelerated APR generation and additional processing options.
* Time series support.
